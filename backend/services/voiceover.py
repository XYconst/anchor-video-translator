When the user uploads a voiceover for a language, we:

  2. Optionally take the matching script section as the source of caption text;
     if no script is provided we transcribe the voiceover with Gemini.
  3. Ask Gemini to find, for each original-video segment, the time range in

  4. Slice the audio at those ranges and feed the slices into the existing
